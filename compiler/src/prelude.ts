/**
 * The implicit prelude injected into every compiled project.
 *
 * Each member's `source` is an exact copy of the canonical, human-facing file in
 * `stdlib/`. The copies are embedded so that `compileProject` stays
 * filesystem-free; when a project supplies its own file at the injection path
 * (e.g. compiling the stdlib itself) that copy wins and the embedded fallback is
 * unused.
 *
 * The text lives in the generated `prelude-sources.ts` — `npm run
 * generate:prelude` — rather than being transcribed here, and a conformance test
 * asserts the embedded copies never drift from the originals.
